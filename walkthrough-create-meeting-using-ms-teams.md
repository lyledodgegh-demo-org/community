# Walkthrough - Create a Meeting using Microsoft Teams

This will show the typical process of creating a meeting as part of a hypothetical recurring series that happens at the end of a release/sprint. This assumes a company using Microsoft Teams, and running the agenda preparation and finalization using GitHub Discussions and Issues.

## Pre-work and setup

- Create a Meeting Agenda template at <your repo>/issues/templates/edit, with something like [Sample Meeting Agenda](sample-meeting-agenda.md).
- Create the draft meeting agenda - see an example at https://github.com/lyledodge-playground-organization/community/issues/5.

## Schedule the Meeting

- Schedule the meeting in your conferencing software, pointing to the meeting agenda above.
- Update the meeting details
  - Click on the meeting, choose more options. Set the desired defaults for people to get into the meeting.
  - Update the GitHub meeting agenda with the conferencing link if applicable.
