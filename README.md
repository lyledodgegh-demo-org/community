*This sample community repository for an open source project is published using GitHub Pages at https://community.lyledodge.me/.*

*The [CNCF Community](https://community.cncf.io/) was used as an example of how to model a good community.*

Welcome to the **Open Source Reference Implementation** Community. The communities below are in support of the open source project.

## Example Community Groups

- **[End User Group](end-user-group.md)** - A regularly occurring meeting for anyone to ask questions to the project stakeholders, maintainers, and other users. All are welcome to join.
- **[Product Management Group](product-roadmap-group.md)** - Aligning near the end of each sprint cycle, solidifying the next few sprint cycle high level tasks. Limited audience by invitation to start, moving to all welcome after a few iterations.
- **[Events](events/readme.md)** - The events page is a home for public and invite events you want to highlight, like product launches, webinars, conferences, etc.

## Some tips on running a community for your Open Source Project

- Leverage the phenomenal [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide). It's good to think through each of the main tiles, and at least jot down your team's initial thoughts on many fo these issues. Some specific tips from the guides that are foundational in my opinion:
  - Figure out what your Contribution guidelines will be that people need to understand when contributing to your project. Spend some time on this, it doesn't have to be complex. This file typically goes in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file. [Microsoft's Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/) is a good example, and you can search the internet for "Contributor License Agreement" examples.
  - Adopt a Code of Conduct, like the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/), which is used by Kubernetes and 40k+ Open Source projects. Make sure to update the contact methods - in the Contributor Covenant for example, search for [INSERT CONTACT METHOD] in the [code_of_conduct.md](code_of_conduct.md) file.
  - Look at the Community Profile under the Insights tab and make sure those are all green check marks.
  - Regularly look at the **GitHub Insights** tab on your repo. Figure out which metrics you want to focus on for the community, and which to focus on for the code repository.
  - You might have a separate private repository for managing internal issues. Make sure you know what's available in [free vs. paid tiers](https://github.com/pricing#compare-features). For example, pages, wikis, requiring approval on code merges, multiple reviewers are all paid features for private repos.
  - Set up some issue templates for consistency. Bug? Feature? Meeting Agendas? Create these at REPO_URL/issues/templates/edit.

## Other GitHub Features to think through

Depending on how "in the open" you will be working, there are some other great things to use:

- Projects Beta - manage projects/tasks/milestones and progress on them in the open.
- You'll likely be using Milestones in your code repository. Do you want to mirror some of those here? Your specific releases (i.e. x.y.z)? Other non-code milestones are useful too - public launch date, some conference you want to socialize at, etc.
- Think through GitHub accounts - most people should be using one account, and get added to organizations. See [Types of GitHub Accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts).
