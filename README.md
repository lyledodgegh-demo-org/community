*This folder (community) should end up being a root level repository of the organization, right now it's published at https://community.lyledodge.me/ so that we can see how the pages behave integrating with issues, discussions, etc.*

Welcome to the **Open Source Reference Implementation** Community. The communities below are in support of the open source project.

# Community Groups

- **[End User Group](end-user-group.md)** - Monthly cadence for anyone to join and ask questions to the project stakeholders and maintainers. All are welcome to join.
- **[Product Management Group](product-roadmap-group.md)** - Aligning near the end of each sprint cycle, solidifying the next few sprint cycle high level tasks. Limited audience by invitation to start, moving to all welcome after a few iterations.
- **[Events](events/readme.md)** - Serving multiple functions, the events page is a home for things like public release meetings, public webinars, conference events, and more.

## Running a Community for your Open Source Project
- [OpenSource.Guide](https://opensource.guide)
  - [Building a Community](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)
  - Adopt a Code of Conduct, like the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/) that is used by Kubernetes and 40k+ Open Source projects. Update the [INSERT CONTACT METHOD] in the code_of_conduct.md file.
  - Figure out what your CONTRIBUTING.md file should have for people contributing to your project. [Microsoft's Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/) is a good example.
  - Regularly look at the **GitHub Insights** tab on your repo. Figure out which metrics you want to focus on for the community, and which to focus on for the code repository.
  - Look at the Community Profile under the Insights tab and make sure those are all green check marks.
  - You might have a separate private repository for managing internal issues. Make sure you know what's available in [free vs. paid tiers](https://github.com/pricing#compare-features). For example, pages, wikis, requiring approval on code merges, multiple reviewers are all paid features for private repos.
  - Figure out what you want in a wiki vs pages vs docs.
  - Set up some issue templates. Bug? Feature? Neither? Agenda for a meeting? Create these at REPO_URL/issues/templates/edit.
    - See this [Sample Meeting Agenda](sample-meeting-agenda.md).
