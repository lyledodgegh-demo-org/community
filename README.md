<!-- for a release - we are modelling the cncf release page at cncf-cncf-online-programs-presents-cncf-live-webinar-kubernetes-123-release/ -->
<!-- for an end user - we are modelling the cncf end user research group at https://community.cncf.io/research-end-user-group/ -->

*This folder (community) should end up being a root level repository of the organization, so that the url ends up being github.com/org/community/ - much like https://community.cncf.io/, we could easily have github.com/myorg/community become https://community.myorg.io/.*

Welcome to the Community. The communities below are in support of the Reference Implementation open source project (todo:link).

# Community Groups

- **[End User Group](/end-user-group)** - Monthly cadence for anyone to join and ask questions to the project stakeholders and maintainers. All are welcome to join.
- **[Product Management Group](/product-roadmap-group)** - Aligning near the end of each sprint cycle, solidifying the next few sprint cycle high level tasks. Limited audience by invitation to start, moving to all welcome after a few iterations. See the [todo:link to pm community page](http://#) for a link to the agenda where you can suggest a topic, and request an invite.
- **[Events](/events)** - Serving multiple functions, the events page is a home for things like public release meetings, public webinars, conference events, and more.

Quetions? Please reach out to (todo:where do we want to send people?).
