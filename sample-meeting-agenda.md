## Why this needs to be a meeting

- This is a regular meeting weâ€™ve all committed to
- We are talking about a topic that greatly benefits from everyone being live at the same time
- We are kicking off a big project and we want everyone on the same page
- Having this meeting will save a lot of back and forth communication

## Pre-work

- Share any context that participants need to know before they attend the meeting. List out items you want everyone to read or prepare ahead of time such as slides, documents, or data. Be specific about what you want people to do before the meeting starts to maximize the discussion time. Should participants bring anything to the meeting?

## OKR reminder

Your OKR (objective and key result) gives your team the alignment they need. It answers the question "Why are we doing this?" and "How will we know when we've done it?"

## Agenda
- Frame these as questions, not items.
- What decisions need to be documented?
- Who committed to specific actions?
